Kennedy Jr. told reporters Monday that he was demanding Secret Service protection after finding a Cheez-It on his kitchen floor. “Today, I’m calling on the White House to move with swiftness and urgency to provide me with appropriate protection against cheese-flavored snack threats,” said the Trump campaign surrogate, who vividly described the terror he felt after he saw the baked menace lying next to his refrigerator and realized he was completely unguarded against stepping on it with his bare feet. “It missed my foot by an inch or less. Obviously, I’ve made many powerful enemies—but which one left this square-shaped cracker there? And who benefited from letting it get this close to me? Congress must answer these questions. Right now, though, I need trained agents sweeping every building I enter for floor-bound snacks to ensure this never happens again.” Kennedy went on to issue a stark warning, stating that if the Cheez-It had been extra cheesy flavored, he would be dead right now."

But once you start, you can’t stop. Ugh, some of these were definitely fraudulent, too. Get out of the way, Eric! I feel like I’m gonna puke!” At press time, the seat of Eric Trump’s pants had reportedly split after he attempted to snack on one more election worker."

You’d like to know who we think is the candidate of change in these troubled times, wouldn’t you?” said registered independent Wren Mogley, who spoke at a press conference held by mischievous undecided voters from across the country, letting a puckish grin twist up from the corners of his mouth before he ducked behind the podium, his cheeks blushing red. “You’ll never guess what tricks we fickle rascals have up our sleeves! Our minds flit ever so unexpectedly from one candidate to the other and then back again. Who oh who will we fancy on Election Day? La, la, la, la, la—the entire country is at our mercy!” According to political analysts, the twinkle in the eyes of the nation’s impish swing voters suggested most would probably forget to go to the polls."

Brian Kemp, which explained that any Georgian who failed to make a sufficiently menacing display of arms would be removed from the premises and excluded from harassing election staff for the 2024 election cycle. “Citizens must brandish an automatic or semiautomatic rifle with a magazine containing at least 30 rounds, and they must also flash or wave around a qualifying sidearm, such as a Glock, revolver, tactical knife, baseball bat, or brass knuckles. Please note: Pepper spray is no longer accepted as a valid form of intimidation.” Kemp’s statement also included a reminder that anthrax-laden ballots must be received by Election Day in order for threats-by-mail to be counted."

I didn’t want to share, either. We were very competitive that way. I said any future daughters could be his, but I think he knew I was bluffing. Besides, it’s not like anyone wanted Tiffany.” Reached for comment, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign denied Trump had just said those things."

Eric Holcomb, who added that the law also requires women to present a marriage license confirming they are wedded to a man and a signed letter from a male head of household stating that they have permission to leave their home. “We want to make sure everyone has gone through all the matrimonial channels necessary before they cast their vote. Given the widespread reports of single women voting in an attempt to undermine the sanctity of our elections, this new law could not come at a more appropriate time.” At press time, hundreds of Indiana women were reportedly purged from voter rolls after it was discovered they were divorced."

Sources confirmed that while the president received repeated assurances from senior advisor Ben LaBolt that he would be “right back,” the whining has become increasingly audible throughout the West Wing since Biden was locked inside the 5-by-5-foot chamber at 8:43 a.m. According to reports, the only successful effort to quiet the commander-in-chief’s feeble cries occurred when several aides slipped wet food under the closet’s door and informed him he was being “a very, very good president.” Although the brief lull that ensued prompted speculation that the 81-year-old had fallen asleep, vacuuming in a nearby room soon reawakened the dormant leader of the free world, who then spent several minutes fearfully scratching at the walls in an attempt to find an exit. At press time, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients was reportedly trying to stop Biden’s low moaning by stressing that if the president held out in there for just five more days, he would get a big, tasty treat."

Kind of silly, but we think it shows off a gentler side of him that most people don’t ever see. We also have this great one where he’s holding a hand to his chin in a pensive pose and has a sweater tied around his shoulders. Really sharp, right? And it didn’t break the bank, either.” At press time, reports confirmed the campaign had further targeted suburban moms with a holiday photo of Trump’s senior staff in matching striped shirts in front of a roaring fire."

All women of breeding age must be kept at least 500 feet away from polling sites to prevent a complete derangement of the American electorate. This is code red!” Vance added that as soon as Election Day was over, it would once more be safe to allow women outdoors to engage in tasks such as grocery shopping and taking the kids to and from school."

She likely would have succumbed anyway, given the combined weight of makeup, lash extensions, and fillers dragging her face down, but it is a tragedy nonetheless. Hopefully her death can serve as a wake-up call to others, such as Lara Trump and Gov. Kristi Noem.” At press time, sources added that for a moment before her death, Guilfoyle looked kind of beautiful.Have a written record of society’s collapse. Get the paper. Become a member."

The two ads—which reports confirmed would air continuously until Nov. 5—showcase clips of Trump’s inflammatory remarks about Jewish people, Black people, and immigrants, including those in which the GOP candidate says “we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now” and suggests new arrivals to the country were poisoning American blood. Both spots reportedly show Trump expounding on conspiracy theories that the Biden administration was “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas” affected by Hurricane Helene, and both claim in large letters that “This is what the next four years would look like under Trump.” However, sources indicated there is a difference in tone between the two ads, with one using sinister music and the other employing a rousing, triumphal score. Numerous viewers told reporters that only at the very end were they able to determine which candidate each ad was supporting, because one spot said “Stop Donald Trump” and the other said “Vote Donald Trump.”Everyday Americans explain why they subscribe to The Onion’s print edition.

Because it’s a lie, folks. She hasn’t spent a second there. She just wants to pander to the people who actually were employed there.” At press time, Trump had devoted a 15-minute campaign stop to working at the White House in an apparent effort to show up Harris and fuel greater uncertainty about her claims."
