Share Share Published: WASHINGTON—Participating in the annual tradition one last time before leaving office, President Joe Biden reportedly told a pardoned Thanksgiving turkey “You’re the Bonnie to my Clyde” on Monday before running off with it and disappearing over the horizon. “It’s us against the world now, turkey,” said the commander-in-chief, grabbing the bird by the wing and laughing wildly as the two of them fled the White House grounds in a convertible, the turkey’s handlers in hot pursuit. “They’re going to keep coming after us, you know, but I’ve got your back, and I know you’ve got mine. It’ll be just you, me, and the wide open road, together until the end. Don’t worry, I’ve got a cozy little place in Delaware we can hide out in until things die down.” At press time, Biden urged the turkey to take the wheel so that he could fend off the Secret Service agents on their tail.

If any trans legislator wants to participate in gymnastics, they’ll just have to join the gym across the street.” Reached for comment, a baffled McBride responded by stating that she had never expressed interest in gymnastics.

It was like a pretty girl who had cat ears, fur, a tail, and really big boobies—you could see the nipples and everything.

But when Uncle Elon said he needed to be alone and tried to take the picture away we got really upset and mad.” At press time, Eric and Donald Jr. were reportedly on the ground wrestling each other over who would get to be the cat girl’s boyfriend first.

Sometimes human food upsets his stomach, so we might pay for it later, but every birthday boy needs a treat. We’ll even put a little candle on top of the hamburger patty for him—who knows how many birthdays the little guy has left?” According to sources, the chef completed the president’s birthday plate by sneaking an antifungal pill beneath the pile of mashed potatoes.

Frankly, I’m tired. So, so tired. All I want to do is to go away forever. A missile launched over 5,500 miles from Eastern Europe would do that exactly. So launch the strike, Volodymyr.

Share Share Published: WASHINGTON—Promising to end what he has called a “war on public health” by the federal government, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, vowed Monday to ban all soaps that smell so good you eat a little. “Big soap companies have been poisoning and deceiving American consumers for decades with these aromatic soaps that really, really convince you a small nibble might actually taste good,” said Kennedy, who promised to declassify all hidden government data about how soap scents like blackberry sage and summer citrus can entice you to lick a corner of the bar, even though it ultimately just tastes like soap. “Insiders have been peddling the lies that these apple cinnamon soaps aren’t dangerous, but I know firsthand how bad they actually taste. There has been a war on America’s taste buds perpetrated by these companies that lie to you with delicious smells that sometimes even drive people to take a second bite just in case the first one wasn’t big enough to really get the flavor. They dress up these soaps in enticing colors and make them smell like delicious pumpkin pie without ever telling people what they do to your body. And this goes for all fruit-scented candles, cleaning products, and markers.” Kennedy added that while he plans to crack down on misleading soaps, lotions like coconut that would obviously taste good because they are made with natural ingredients will still be considered safe.
