Even as I look at you now, I can see no body language indicating a level of romantic chemistry sufficient to warrant a marriage license. Your affection, though it may exist, is just not at the threshold of making me hear wedding bells when you gaze into each other’s eyes.” At press time, sources confirmed the couple had successfully appealed the ruling after Garcia gave his fiancée a tennis bracelet that must have cost at least $800."

Occasionally, though, she’ll like one of her own photos of us spending time together.” At press time, Barnes family members confirmed their mother had sent a message that consisted of nothing but a large red heart emoji and had then added a heart reaction to the heart."

I feel really bad if that car crash was because of me. Darn. We probably could have just walked.” At press time, Stanton added that she felt particularly ashamed after realizing the patient whose call she was responding to had already passed away during her 27-second drive."

So when she saw the man with his jar of Hellmann’s, she made him a proposition: He could either give her the mayonnaise, or he could die. I asked her how she felt about this now, and she just said sandwich spreads were hard to come by back then and the man had made his choice.” At press time, Sipple was reportedly listing on her fingers the various other items—eggs, flour, chewing gum, an Indian head nickel—she had killed people over during the worst economic crisis in American history."

I know nobody wants to spend their weekend hanging out with my kids, but I’m really up against the wall here. I’d be glad to return the favor any weekend when a friend hasn’t scored free Seahawks tickets and invited me to come with him.” At press time, sources confirmed Bouchard had texted again to see if one of his coworkers could fill in for him at an upcoming family court hearing."

Sulzer then told his friends—in manner that recalled the famed 16th-century admiral lowering a brass telescope from his eyes to sketch out his destination on a parchment map before the stunned sailors of theTrinidad—that one restaurant was apparently BYOB.“You couldn’t see it before, but I guess if you jiggle the screen around a little bit, sometimes more stuff shows up. There’s a burger place, too.” At press time, sources confirmed that the employees at a local buffalo wing restaurant were warmly greeting Sulzer and his friends like natives welcoming Magellan’s crew, unbeknownst to the horrors that awaited them."

I always tell HR they should have him sit in on job interviews, because if a candidate doesn’t love Comet, you’ll know right away they aren’t a good fit forthiscompany!” At press time, after bringing his dog into the sales team’s meeting with a potential client and hollering, “This little guy right here is what it’s all about!” Lutz had reportedly been fired."

God, I’m such an asshole. Maybe I’ll just say something vague, like some family stuff came up.” At press time, Garner could reportedly be heard screaming in agony after his friend put the final nail in his coffin with a polite “No worries, I’m happy to work around your schedule!”"

Keep the car running, though, because if he puts up a fight, I may have to whale on his ass for a while before I can make my getaway.” At press time, witnesses confirmed security had subdued the contract killer after he paused in the middle of carrying out his hit to check the guitar’s tuning."

I’m actually nervous because I don’t want to waste my time in bed by tossing and turning and let my family down. My dad really encouraged me because it was always his dream to go to bed, but he never had the chance.” At press time, Torres had incurred $45,000 of debt after his first week in bed."

It’s so much better to have a knife with you and not need it than it is tonothave a knife and be in one of these tight spots where you do need it. See? All I need to do now is jam the blade into the side here and…no. Well, what if I sort of saw it, like this? Then—aw, shit, that hurts!” At press time, the man’s daughter, Jennifer Ballard, was said to have thrown out the partially opened can of chili after determining it had too much blood on it to be edible."

We can only hope there’s a chance of him coming back as America’s everyman. It’s an incredibly somber night at Arrowhead Stadium.” At press time, both teams had reportedly taken knees at the sidelines to pray that Kelce’s first film saw strong box office returns."

Oh! Buffalo University! Is that correct? It sounds kind of familiar. I’m pretty sure I’ve seen the campus, but that might have just been a parking lot near the football field. If I’m being honest, I don’t care.” Sanders went on to ask reporters what the people in the stadium do when football games aren’t happening."

Even worse, Clancy would call over other officials, urging them to ‘check this out.’ This breach of conduct has no place in the NFL, especially from those responsible for enforcing the rules, and he will be disciplined accordingly.” At press time, authorities confirmed that the referee would be placed under a supervision plan and watched over by an HR representative during all upcoming games."

It starts at $249.99 but that gets you hundreds of different domestic violence suits to choose from during the year, including civil suits, and the package covers related gun, drug, and reckless driving trials. It’s the best way to watch all the biggest stars in the NFL.” Ellis added that while Grand Jury subscribers will have access to almost every domestic violence trial, the package will not cover NFL Thursday Trials that are licensed exclusively to Amazon Prime."

Fast-forward a couple of days, and I’m in Dallas wearing a Cowboy’s jersey and the whole team is calling me ‘Captain Tom Brady.’ Watch.

Bengals head coach Zac Taylor looks like he’s in a state of shock. Hopefully Burrow can recover, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s out for the season.

Completely frozen. Even if he was just trying to train it, there is absolutely no excuse for that kind of behavior.

Sadly, we no longer have any idea who has the most career home runs or no-hitters, and any theory as to why Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, or Pedro Martinez were so highly regarded is now squarely in the domain of speculation.” At press time, Manfred paid tribute to the brave souls who lost their lives attempting to save the stats for the 2003 Detroit Tigers."

Some of these people actually paid to watch you, which—baffling as that may be—ought to provide some kind of motivation. Right? Does any of what I’m saying making sense to you?

I really don’t take the coordinated effort to assassinate me personally. If anything, violently taking a shiv to my back, chest, and neck during a breakaway shows how much passion these women have for the game, and I’m lucky to play alongside them. In some ways, I’d even say it’s an advantage to be putting pressure on my jugular with my left hand while dribbling with my right. I’d be mad too if one of them got as much viscera on the ball as I did.” A stern Clark went on to tell the media that if she could pull the dozen or so blades out of her back and move on, they should be able to get over it too."

Our anthropological data suggests he was a feared pack leader around 40,000 years ago, so it’s particularly entertaining to see him get frustrated when the lab’s other Neanderthals, who are still frozen, don’t obey his commands to flay us alive.” White added that when it was time to refreeze the angry Neanderthal, researchers simply handed him a tablet computer and let TikTok’s algorithm lull him into total complacency."

Houses just aren’t meant to get wet. No insurance company anywhere would take on that kind of liability.

While it’s heartening to watch these activists secretly transport a handful of male donuts to a baked goods sanctuary in rural Vermont, millions more are dying barbaric deaths every day, all to satisfy America’s insatiable demand for pastry.” The video follows a government report last month that found stress among Coolattas living in filthy, cramped conditions causes the frozen beverages to brutally slurp one another to death."

They might lack organelles or an organized nucleus, but we all share in God’s abundant love.” At press time, the Vatican lamented that dozens of spear-wielding bacteria had killed every member of its first micro-mission."

By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that’s when you gaslight her and tell her she’s crazy.” According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it’s like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce."

Thankfully, we had a lot of stunt professionals working with us to make sure nothing too serious happened—although I did get a black eye from the left one.” Powell added that his mentor Tom Cruise had given him a lot of helpful advice from his experience filming with Salma Hayek."

Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos.Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election.Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in.Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president.And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup.Tu Stultus Es,The Onion Editorial Board"
